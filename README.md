# Parkinsons-Disease-Prediction
ML Project using SVM


This is a Python code that demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to predict Parkinson's disease using patient voice recordings.

The code imports the necessary libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn (sklearn) for data analysis, SVM algorithm, and accuracy score evaluation. The Parkinson's dataset is loaded and analyzed. 

The code preprocesses the dataset by separating the features and target, splitting the data into training and testing sets, and standardizing the data. SVM model is trained on the standardized training set and evaluated on both training and testing sets using the accuracy score.

Finally, the code builds a predictive system that takes in an input in the form of a list of voice recording features and predicts whether the person has Parkinson's disease or not using the trained SVM model.
